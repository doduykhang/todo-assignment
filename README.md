## Task Description
Your task for this challenge is to create a small todo app 

A todo is a task yet to be done; an item on a to-do list.
A todo must have these properties
    id
    title
    description
    created time
    is done

## Requirements
The basic search engine should be capable of the following three operations.

1. The app should be able to display the list to todo
2. The app should be able to create a new todo
3. The app should be able to update information of a todo
4. The app should be able to delete a todo

### User Interface
The user interface should be a browser-based application developed using your JavaScript web framework of choice. It should support the three aforementioned operations. How this is done is completely up to you. Use your creativity and imagination to create a UI that will set your submission apart!

### REST API (OPTIONAL)
This part is optional you, but will be considered bonus points if you provide them.
The REST API can be implemented using whatever language and frameworks of your choosing. Again, like the UI, it needs to support the three operations listed above. How you choose to accomplish this task is up to you.
